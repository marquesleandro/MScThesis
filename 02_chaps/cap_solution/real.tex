For this case, the numerical simulation is performed for a real 
coronary artery with atherosclerosis whose geometry was obtained 
through an image processing as suggested by Wang et al. (2017) 
\cite{wang2017}. This geometry is particular to each patient 
due to the patient health conditions. As in the previous cases, 
an channel obstruction of 40\% was considered due to atherosclerosis 
and the domain was discretized using 7632 nodes and 14665 linear 
triangular elements. 

\par 
The \ref{velocity evolution real} shows the velocity profile 
in the middle of the channel ($x=5R$). The maximum non-dimensional
 value of the velocity field reaches $u=2.25$. Thus, the 
curved geometry represents a good approximation as seen in 
\ref{velocity evolution curved}, 
such that the difference of maximum non-dimensional velocity value 
is about 2\%.

\newpage
The 
\ref{velocity field real} 
shows the evolution in time and space of the velocity field for half of the
domain The velocity field is represented with non-dimensional values where the red color
refers to the value 
$u=2.25$
and the blue color 
$u=0$
approximately. 
Converting to dimensional
values we have 
$u = 27.0cm/s$
 and 
$u = 0cm/s$ 
respectively.
