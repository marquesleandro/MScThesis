A monophase, steady and fully developed flow of a 
Newtonian and incompressible fluid between parallel horizontal 
plates, where the lower plate moves with \textit{$U_{bottom}$} 
velocity and the upper plate moves with \textit{$ U_{top}$}, 
is known as \textit{Couette flow}. The \ref{couette}
 presents schematically this flow and the profile of the expected velocity field.

\noindent
The velocity profile equation is shown below:

\begin{equation}
 u = \big[ U_{top} - U_{bottom} \big] \frac{y}{L} + U_{bottom}
\end{equation}

\medskip
\noindent
where $U_{top}$ is the top plate velocity and its value is
$U_{top} = 1$, 
$U_{bottom}$ is the bottom plate velocity and its value is
$U_{bottom} = -1$, 
$L$ is non-dimensional length
between the plates and its value is $L = 1$
and $y$ is the vertical coordinates and it varies between 
$y = \big[ 0,1 \big]$.
The domaian was discretizes using a linear triangula mesh with 
3835 nodes and 7299 elements.

The \ref{velocidade couette} shows the steady state velocity profile
when $Re=100$.
It is possible to observe that the numerical solution 
converges to the analytical solution.
