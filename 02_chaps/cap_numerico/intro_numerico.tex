In this chapter, we will present the main characteristics 
of the computational code developed in Python 2.7 \cite{python} 
using the object-oriented paradigm (OOP) in order to reuse the code 
in other simulations in the future. 
Initially, the UML diagram is shown by \ref{uml} and
the code framework is presented. In addition, the
average processing time for each process is shown.
Lastly, the Laplacian smoothing approach is presented
with its applicability.
