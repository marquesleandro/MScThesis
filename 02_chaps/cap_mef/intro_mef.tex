In this chapter, we will describe the Finite Element Method (FEM). 
While the Finite Difference Method (MDF) represents
 a direct approximation to the differential equations, 
the proposal of the finite element procedure is 
an approximation applied to the terms of the 
variational formulation as mentioned by Zienkiewicz and Cheung (1965) 
\cite{zienkiewicz1965}. 
For more details on the Finite Element Method see the works of 
Zienkiewicz and Taylor (2000) \cite{zienkiewiczvol3}, 
Hughes (2000) \cite{hughes2000} and 
Fish and Belytschko (2007) \cite{fish2007}.

First, we will discretize the governing equations in time 
using the Taylor series approximation, keeping the second order 
terms of the expansion in order to reduce the spurious oscillations 
present in the convection-diffusion equations as 
in the case of the vorticity and concentration equations. 
Then, we will present the strong formulation of them. 
That done, the weak formulation of the governing equations is 
presented and they are discretized in space using Galerkin's Method 
with a linear triangular element. 
Therefore, the government equations in the matrix form 
according to the \textit{Taylor-Galerkin} Method are presented. 
For more details on the scheme, see the work of 
Donea (1984) \cite{donea1984}.
