In this chapter, we will describe the Finite Element Method (FEM). 
The mathematical basis for the Finite Element Method begins in 1910s
 with Ritz \cite{ritz1909} and Galerkin (1915) \cite{galerkin1915}.
The proposal of the finite element procedure is 
an approximation applied to the terms of the 
variational formulation, 
for more details on the Finite Element Method see the works of 
Zienkiewicz and Taylor (2000) \cite{zienkiewiczvol3} and
Hughes (2000) \cite{hughes2000}.

First, we will present the variational formulation with its
the strong and weak form of the
governing equations. 
Next, they are discretized in space using Galerkin Method 
with a linear triangular element and then
the semi-Lagrangian Method is used to discretize
them over time.
Lastly, the matrix form
of the governing equations are presented.
