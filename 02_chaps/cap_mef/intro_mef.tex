In this chapter, we will describe the Finite Element Method (FEM). 
The mathematical basis for the Finite Element Method begins in 1910s
 with Ritz \cite{ritz1909} and Galerkin (1915) \cite{galerkin1915}.
The proposal of the finite element procedure is 
an approximation applied to the terms of the 
variational formulation, 
for more details on the Finite Element Method see the works of 
Zienkiewicz and Taylor (2000) \cite{zienkiewiczvol3} and
Hughes (2000) \cite{hughes2000}.

First, we will present the strong formulation of the
governing equations. 
Then, the weak formulation of them is 
presented and they are discretized in space using Galerkin Method 
with a linear triangular element. 
Finally, the semi-Lagrangian Method is used to discretize
the governing equations over time and the matrix form
of them are presented.
