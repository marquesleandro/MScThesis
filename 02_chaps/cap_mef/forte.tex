Governing equations in differential form 
with boundary conditions are known as \textbf{Strong Formulation}. 
Thus, the strong formulation for the proposed problem is:

\begin{align}
& \frac{D w}{D t}
 +
 \textbf{c} \cdot \nabla w
 =
 \frac{1}{Re} \nabla^{2} w
 \\[10pt] 
& \nabla^{2} \psi
 = 
 - 
 w \\[10pt]
& \frac{D e}{Dt}
 +
 \textbf{c} \cdot \nabla e
 =
 \frac{1}{ReSc} \nabla^{2} e
\end{align}


\medskip
\noindent
These equations are valid in 
$\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ domain
with the following boundary conditions:

\begin{equation} \label{bc}
 \begin{aligned}
  w = w_\Gamma \quad & \mbox{in $\Gamma_1$}\\
  \psi = \psi_\Gamma \quad & \mbox{in $\Gamma_2$}\\
  c = c_\Gamma \quad & \mbox{in $\Gamma_4$}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
