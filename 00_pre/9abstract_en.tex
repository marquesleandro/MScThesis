\indent The present work aims at developing a computational framework to simulate blood flow in coronary artery with
drug-eluting stent placed using Vorticity-Streamfunction Formulation in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach.
The blood was modeled as single-phase, incompressible and newtonian fluid and. The Navier-Stokes equation is shown according to the vorticity-streamfunction formulation with pecies transport equation.
The Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to solve the governing equations where the Galerkin formulation was used
to discretized the equations in space and the semi-Lagrangian method was used to discretized the material derivative
using first order backward difference scheme. The linear systems was solved using Conjugate Gradient Iterative Method.
